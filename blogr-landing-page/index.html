            <h2>Introducing an extensible editor</h2>
            <p>
                Blogr features an exceedingly intuitive interface which lets you focus on one thing: creating
                content.
                The editor supports management of multiple blogs and allows easy manipulation of embeds such as
                images,
                videos, and Markdown. Extensibility with plugins and themes provide easy ways to add functionality
                or
                change the looks of a blog.
            </p>
            <h2>Robust content management</h2>
            <p>
                Flexible content management enables users to easily move through posts. Increase the usability of
                your
                blog
                by adding customized categories, sections, format, or flow. With this functionality, youâ€™re in full
                control.
